### What you'll find (and where) in this repository:

Scripts for the QTL analyses and mechanistic species distribution modelling from Evolution of thermal physiology alters species distributions under climate change (*Wuitchik et al., in revision, Mol Ecol*). Currently, these scripts show the general analyses but are not optomized for generalizable or automatic running. There is a small amount of manual editing/combining of files required. The QTL and SDM analyses are completely separate but from the same manuscript.


**01_process_seq:** scripts for processing and filtering ddRAD sequencing data  
**02_linkageMap_QTL:** scripts for the construction of family-specific linkage maps and identifying quantitative trait loci associated with thermal physiology  
**03_tempRasters:** scripts for creating temperature rasters for multiple climate change and evolutionary scenarios  
**04_maps:** scripts for creating species distribution maps from the rasters generated in 03_tempRasters
